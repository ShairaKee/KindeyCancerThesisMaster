    "# Dataset Simple Filter Creation\n",
    "This section will focus on establishing a simple filter based on mean and standard deviation of pixel values of the tiled sildes to establish a filter that would select images with GOOD, PARTIAL or BLANK tissues within the tiles generated. This filter exploits the average pixel value found within the tile images and gets the average mean and standard deviation of a tile that fits in the category. Note: The intial data used was manually seperated into GOOD PARTIAL and BLANK folders.\n",

    "* Partial -  Tiles that have less than 80% tissue\n",

    "Since we want to figure out the amount of tissue slide in the tiled images, one way of doing it is by taking advantage of pixel values since we would know that blank tiles would have higher mean and lower standard deviation this is because white pixels tend to have higher values and the lack of deviation between the pixel values since everything is white. On the other hand, good pixels would have lower pixel values since the pixel would have a darker shade and have higher standard deviation since the tiles would have much further range of pixel values."
